1. It stops class explosion for different sub types.
2. When there is long constructor parameter list means having lots of optional properties in class.

Decorator Vs Builder
1. Buider is creator design pattern.
2. Decorator is structural design pattern.
3. Builder pattern cannot handle dynamic requests but decorator can support request for objects.
4. Means In decorator we decorate new object on top of previous one. 
   But in Builder we create a complex object with help of multiple sub objects & they are not interchangeable.
